*Project Hermes is a project dedicated to transitioning point cloud data retrieved from Kinect SLAM or any other system into a tangible environment, playable and manipulable in virtual reality.*

---
## Overarching plan

1. Gather point cloud data using a Kinect
2. Transfer point cloud data to a program of choice and extract a solid model
3. Import solid model to Unity or other 3d program to design VR scene.
